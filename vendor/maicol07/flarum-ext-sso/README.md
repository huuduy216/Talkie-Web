# Flarum SSO

This extension equips Flarum with Single Sign On (shortly SSO). The workflow is based on this 
[post](https://discuss.flarum.org/d/2808-how-i-implemented-cross-authentication-with-flarum).
The extension is useful if you run Flarum on a subdomain but you want to use the login mechanism 
of your main website. A dummy main website is provided in the `sample-website/` folder.

## Documentation
Check the [docs](https://docs.maicol07.it/flarum_sso/introduction) to know more about the extension, how to install it and to use it.
