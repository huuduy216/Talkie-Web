# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in Contributing to our theme 😀.

We sometimes really need help when we're stuck with some issues 😖. But if you help us, we always continue improving our theme for you 😋.

So, let me explain how you can contribute.

We prepared some pre-built templates for you easily submit issues (Bug reports and feature requests) and open Pull Requests to resolve open issues. 📇

Just click on "Create issue" or "Create Pull Request" to see what to do. 📝

But before doing all that stuff, please read our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/Extum/flarum-theme-material/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). 🔍
